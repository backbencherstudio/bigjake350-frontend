        question: "Apostille Services",
        answer: "An Apostille (pronounced “ah-po-steel”) is a French word meaning certification. An Apostille is simply the name for a specialized certificate, issued by the Secretary of State. The Apostille is attached to your original document to verify it is legitimate and authentic so it will be accepted in one of the other countries who are members of the Hague Apostille Convention. How Does Apostille Service Work? We are happy to help you in person if we are local to you or if not, I have the ability to help anyone from anywhere in the world via our remote online platform. We prefer a phone call/zoom ahead of time and to see the documents so we can give accurate pricing as each Apostilled document is different. (This includes all 50 States.) The way it works is you contact us either in the US at 727-435-7865 or use the same number for WhatsApp/Signal if you are outside the US. Zoom is also an option. Once we figure out how we are working together and we see the documents so we know exactly what they need to have done, we can then provide accurate pricing. When we meet, we will do exactly what we discussed and then we will send the documents to our contact in Tallahassee who will help expedite the process. In a few days time, your documents will be back to you, ready to go. Expected turn around time (excluding weekends and holidays) should not be more than a week, once we get everything moving. Pricing: Pricing for this service is done by the document and is dependent on several variables that include but are not limited to: Cost to ship to Tallahassee Cost to ship back to you or wherever you want the documents to go If we need to have the documents translated State Fees to Apostille your document Watching your documents very closely as they are in transit and providing updates along the way is a standard thing we provide for each client. Because many of these variables are not the same, this is why I cannot quote pricing without seeing the documents and speaking with you ahead of time. I want to use your service but I do not speak English…. If the languages spoken provide barriers to getting this work accomplished there will be an additional fee for me to bring a translator into the transaction to make sure everything is completely understood. We will find a way to get your documents apostilled! *We work with all 50 states, the US Dept of State and all of the embassies.",
